# Print training accuracies
print("Softmax     training accuracy:", lr_mn.score(X_train, y_train))
print("One-vs-rest training accuracy:", lr_ovr.score(X_train, y_train))

# Create the binary classifier (class 1 vs. rest)
lr_class_1 = LogisticRegression(C=100)
lr_class_1.fit(X_train, y_train==1)

# Plot the binary classifier (class 1 vs. rest)
plot_classifier(X_train, y_train==1, lr_class_1)






As you can see, the binary classifier incorrectly labels almost all
points in class 1 (shown as red triangles in the final plot)! Thus,
this classifier is not a very effective component of the one-vs-rest
classifier. In general, though, one-vs-rest often works well.
